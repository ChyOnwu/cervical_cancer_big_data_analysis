# cervical_cancer_big_data_analysis
This project examines cervical cancer risk factors that influence the need for a screening. It uses PySpark for Big Data analysis and reliably compares three different ML classification algorithms - Logistics regression, Random Forest classifier and Naives Bayes - in predicting / calculating the likelihood of needing a cervical cancer biopsy. The project also attempts to identify observation clusters by applying K-means clustering on the data on age, age of first sexual experience, number of sexual partners, number of pregnancies, and Human papillomavirus (HPV).  Tableau software is used for the data visualization to help understand the data better and make informed decisions.
